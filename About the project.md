# Scalable Similarity Search in Healthcare  
SC4020 - Data Analytics and Mining (Group Project)

## Overview  
This project evaluates and compares exact and approximate similarity search methods on real-world healthcare datasets. We implement and analyze:
- Brute Force K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 
- Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) using the Annoy library  
The goal is to understand the trade-offs between **retrieval accuracy** and **computational efficiency**, especially as dataset size scales.
